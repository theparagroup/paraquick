--[to force remove web connector app]
	To remove the problem QWC information, you will need to remove the keys from the registry for the Web Connector.

		Registry Key: \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Intuit\QBWebConnector
		Delete the key entry from under the Scheduler and SOAPWebServices

	Deleting these keys will remove it from the Web Connector. Then you can go into QuickBooks and remove the app from the Integrated Preferences panel.
